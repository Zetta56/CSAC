# ChromaClicker
This is an auto-clicker for the Android OS. In short, this performs a click gesture if all detected pixels on-screen match the desired colors. 

## Features
- Multi-point clicking
- Simple menu to add, remove, and position clickers
- Customizable color detectors associated with each clicker. This forces the clicker to run only when all on-screen pixels being detected match the detectors' desired colors.
- Color dipper for pixel color and coordinates
- Savable clicker layouts
- Randomized clicking

## Permissions
- Draw Overlays: used to display settings menus over other apps
- Accessibility API: used to perform clicks, a vital part of this app's auto-clicker
- Media Projection API: used to detect on-screen pixel colors
