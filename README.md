# ChromaClicker
This is an auto-clicker for the Android OS. In short, this performs a click gesture if all detected pixels on-screen match the desired colors. 

**This is available now on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chromaclicker.app)!**

## Features

- Randomized clicking
